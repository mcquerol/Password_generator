# Password generator in python

This is my first python program, generating a password based on 3 lists, the user decides how many of each (letters, numbers and symbols to use)

10/03/2023 using simple for loops to get a random element from each of the lists
12/03/2023 implemented a list for the password, this allows for the randomly generated code to be followed so not all characters are followed in order (letters, numbers then symbols)
